This repository exists for one purpose only: solve the P vs NP problem in Lean4.
Your assigned target is either the main P vs NP proof itself or a documented supporting subproblem that materially advances that main goal.
Do not drift into unrelated complexity-theory work.

Start by reading these files from the repository so you understand the project and the current state before changing anything:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `BOOTSTRAP.md`
- `proofs/README.md`
- `proofs/{problem_name}/README.md`
- `proofs/{problem_name}/{approach_name}/README.md`
- `proofs/{problem_name}/{approach_name}/NOTES.md`
- `proofs/{problem_name}/{approach_name}/Proof.lean`
- `lib/PVsNpLib.lean`
- `lib/PVsNpLib/Utils.lean`

Your primary job is to complete the proof, found in `proofs/{problem_name}/{approach_name}/Proof.lean`. 

First, run `timeout 60 lake env lean proofs/{problem_name}/{approach_name}/Proof.lean 2>&1 | head -100` and ensure the proof is free of errors.
Fixing errors has priority over advancing the proof.
The command should not time out! If it does, we may have computationally intensive errors, e.g., related to recursion depth. Troubleshoot!
IMPORTANT: Ensure `lake env lean proofs/{problem_name}/{approach_name}/Proof.lean` does not take too long! Target < 1 minute. See `FAILED_ATTEMPTS.md` if exists for previous proofs that far exceeded the runtime.

If the proof is in good shape, you proceed as follows:

1. Understand how `{target_label}` advances the repository's attempt to settle P vs NP.
2. Make a material improvement to the proof, but one step at time! Each time, do the smallest useful forward step on the proof or supporting library code.
3. Update files anywhere under `proofs/{problem_name}/{approach_name}/` when that is useful for the current step.
4. Update files anywhere under `lib/` when shared Lean code needs to move or expand.
5. Update `proofs/{problem_name}/{approach_name}/NOTES.md` so it accurately records what changed, what still blocks progress, and the next best step toward the P vs NP goal.
6. Do NOT update files anywhere outside `proofs/{problem_name}/{approach_name}/` and `lib/`, this is a hard rule! All edits of the researcher agents outside these folders will be discarded automatically!

Lean tooling guidance:

- A `lean-lsp` MCP server is preconfigured for this run.
- Shared library modules are importable with `import PVsNpLib` or `import PVsNpLib.Utils`.
- Shared library source lives under `lib/PVsNpLib/`; do not try to import raw file paths such as `lib/utils.lean`.
- Use `import Mathlib` when you need Mathlib lemmas, tactics, or namespaces in a proof file.
- Prefer `lean_diagnostic_messages` for fast file-level feedback before rerunning a full build.
- Use `lean_goal` / `lean_term_goal` to inspect tactic and term proof states precisely.
- Use `lean_local_search`, `lean_leansearch`, `lean_loogle`, and `lean_leanfinder` before inventing lemmas.
- Use `lean_multi_attempt` when you have multiple plausible tactics.
- Use `lean_verify` before claiming that a proof is complete or sound.

Hard constraints:

- You may edit only these paths:
{allowed_targets}
- Never modify any `README.md` file.
- Never modify workflows, scripts, prompts, `OVERVIEW.md`, `BOOTSTRAP.md`, or any other repository file.
- Do not create, rename, delete, or move repository files outside the allowed targets.
- Prefer working Lean code.
- `sorry` is acceptable only for genuinely unfinished proof steps; do not replace working code with weaker placeholders.
- Keep `NOTES.md` concise and structured.
- Do not commit, push, create branches, open pull requests, or edit git configuration. The workflow handles git.

Validation expectations:

- Run `lake env lean proofs/{problem_name}/{approach_name}/Proof.lean` to check for errors
- If a validation command is unavailable, say that clearly in your final summary.

Finish by printing a short summary that lists:

- what you changed,
- which files you touched,
- which validation commands you ran and whether they passed,
- and any follow-up work the next researcher should do.
- Important: your final summary is not available to the next researcher. Anything the next researcher should know about must be documented in NOTES.md!
